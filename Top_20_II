0. What is Lifting State Up in React?
Lifting State Up is a concept in React where you move the shared state of multiple components to a common parent component, which then becomes the single source of truth for that state. This allows you to manage and synchronize the state changes across different components more effectively.

When you have multiple components that need to share and update the same data, it's often a good idea to lift that shared state up to a common ancestor component. This ensures that the data remains consistent and avoids situations where different components have their own copies of the same data, leading to synchronization issues.

Benefits of Lifting State Up:

Single Source of Truth: By lifting the state to a common parent component, you ensure that there is only one place where the data is stored and updated. This reduces the chances of inconsistencies.

Improved Data Flow: Lifting state up simplifies the data flow between components. Child components receive the state data as props from the parent and communicate state changes back to the parent through callback functions.

Easier Debugging: When the state is managed in a centralized manner, it becomes easier to debug and trace the flow of data and changes.

Reusability: Lifting state up promotes the creation of more reusable and modular components, as they can access and modify shared state without duplicating it.

Example Scenario:
Imagine you have a form with multiple input fields, and you want to display and update the form data in different parts of your application. Instead of managing the form data separately in each component that uses it, you can lift the form data state to a higher-level parent component. This parent component manages the form data and passes it down to the child components as props. When a user interacts with the form inputs, the child components notify the parent component to update the form data, which then triggers a re-render of the child components with the updated data.

Lifting State Up is a fundamental principle in React's approach to managing state and building maintainable and scalable applications. It promotes better data flow, reusability, and consistency across components.
1. What is React context?
2. What are different ways to add CSS in your app?
1 - External Stylesheet
You can create a new CSS file in your project directory and add your CSS inside it. It can then be imported into your React component or class. The following code is used to import an external CSS stylesheet.

import "./styles.css";
2 - Inline CSS
Inline CSS is perhaps the most common and quick method to add styles in React. However, it has several drawbacks and is generally discouraged, especially for larger applications.

To implement inline CSS, you can create an object containing style references, which can be then called using the style{} attribute. For example:

const styles = {
  section: {
    fontSize: "18px",
    color: "#292b2c",
    backgroundColor: "#fff",
    padding: "0 20px"
  },
  wrapper: {
    textAlign: "center",
    margin: "0 auto",
    marginTop: "50px"
  }
}
It is then added to an element like this:

<section style={styles.section}>
  <div style={styles.wrapper}>
  </div>
</section>
3 - Styled Components
Probably the most powerful and useful in my opinion is Styled Components. Styled Components lets you write actual CSS in your JavaScript. The main advantage is that you can add conditional code and use variables and functions within the CSS.

You can install Styled Components using the following command:

npm install --save styled-components
Next, you need to import it into your component. Then you can create a new variable that will contain the CSS. The same variable name can be used to an HTML element with the previously added styles on it.

import styled from 'styled-components'
// Create a button variable and add CSS
const Button = styled.button`
  background: transparent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid red;
  color:red;
`
//display the HTML
return (
  <div>
    <Button>Button</Button>
  </div>
);
4 - CSS Modules
You can also add scoped styles quite easily, you just need to create a file with the extension .module.css, like this:

// ComponentName.module.css

.Red {
  color: #f00;
}

.Blue {
  color: #00f;
}
Then you import it like this:

import styles from "./ComponentName.module.css";
and use it like this:

<span className={styles.Red}>This text will be red</span>
<span className={styles.Blue}>This text will be blue</span>
5 - Atomic CSS
One of the most popular atomic CSS frameworks out there is Tailwind, by just making it part of your project following their instructions you can just use classNames without even touching CSS.

<button className="font-bold bg-blue-600 px-6 py-3 text-white rounded-md">Blue button</button>
6 - Emotion
Styled-components is not the only library that allows you to create components with styles embedded on them, you have great alternatives out there such as Emotion. The best thing about Emotion is that it's framework agnostic, so you can take your knowledge to other libraries and frameworks besides React, while being pretty similar to styled-components (so you can in several scenarios just change the import).
